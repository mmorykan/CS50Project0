                Since April 1, 2020, we have been printing and assembling face shields and stethoscopes for the COVID-19 relief efforts.
                There are four of us, excluding our advisor, who go into the lab everyday to monitor prints and start assembling pieces together.
                We have literally been working 24/7 each of us taking 1, 6 hour shift per day. In order to produce as much as possible by May 1, 2020, one of us was always in the lab making sure 
                nothing ever went wrong. On top of this, we had to continue to participate in our daily classes while always staying alert for the printers.
                This has been an amazing, though sometimes stressful, experience and it does not end here. We will continue and march on until our efforts
                are no longer required. So far, we have produced and shipped 500 stethoscopes for St. Lukes Hospitals and about 200 face shields for doctors, 
                fire stations, dentists, and the Lehigh Valley Health Network. We look forward to continuing our journey.
