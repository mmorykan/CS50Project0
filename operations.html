        <p>This course was one of the more difficult courses for me because it was hard to see exactly where these techniques and processes were 
        being applied. This class was very intense in the study of different algorithms which is great knowledge to have, but I don't think 
        I'll really use most of this information later on. My final grades are as follows:
