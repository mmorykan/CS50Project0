            <p>
                As a sophomore computer science major, I have been documenting my experiences and grades in my most challenging courses
                upon completion. Most of this documentation includes:
                <ul>
                    <li>Assignments</li>
                    <li>Projects and Goals</li>
                    <li>Summaries</li>
                </ul>
                Aside from these attributes, I also keep track of my grade for each course and calculate my department GPA after a completed semester.
                As of the beginning of my junior year (2020), my grades for all computer science classes are as follows:
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Class</th>
                        <th>Grade</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Computer Science 1 (Python)</th>
                        <th>A</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Computer Science 2 (Java)</th>
                        <th>A</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Data Structures and Analysis of Algorithms</th>
                        <th>A</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>System Administration</th>
                        <th>A</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Computer Organization</th>
                        <th>A</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Networking and Distributed Computing</th>
                        <th>A</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Final Department GPA</th>
                        <th>4.0</th>
                    </tr>
                </table>
            </p>
        </div>
