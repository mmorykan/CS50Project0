                As a sophomore computer science major, I have been documenting my experiences and grades in my most challenging courses
                upon completion. Most of this documentation includes:
                <ul>
                    <li>Assignments and Solutions</li>
                    <li>Projects and Goals</li>
                    <li>Overviews</li>
                </ul>
                Aside from these attributes, I also keep track of my grade for each course and calculate my department GPA after a completed semester.
