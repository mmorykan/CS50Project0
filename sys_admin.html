            My time in this class was amazing even though the last project was extremely taxing to complete. I believe that I learned a lot 
            about the bash terminal and bash scripting as well as how to configure services and software on my computer. 
            My final grades for the course were as follows:
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Assignment</th>
                    <th>Grade</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Homework 1</th>
                    <th>50 / 50</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Homework 2</th>
                    <th>44 / 50</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Homework 3</th>
                    <th>41.5 / 50</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Homework 4</th>
                    <th>45 / 50</th>
